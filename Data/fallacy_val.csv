"Elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 also enable plants to better withstand the growth-retarding effects of various environmental stresses, including soil salinity, air pollution, high and low air temperatures, and air-borne and soil-borne plant pathogens.",oversimplification,3.3.1,CARDS
CET winter December March temperatures have shown an even more significant loss -1.45C in the last 13 years of since 2000.,anecdote,1.3,CARDS
The dead have nothing to do with a periodic cycle in the Earth's climate. We feel hip because we have a few hundred years of data. Science has shown that climate change and major shifts happen all the time.,single cause,2.1.4,hamburg_test2
"Plants in a CO2 enriched atmosphere generally prefer warmer temperatures than those exposed to air with lower CO2, Idso said as he described a series of experiments. The doubling of the airs Co2 concentration typically boosts the optimum temperature for plant photosynthesis by several degrees centigrade and this also raises the temperature at which plants experience heat related death.",oversimplification,3.3.1,CARDS
"Canberrans felt the worst of the cold on Wednesday, when temperatures fell to minus 6.1 degrees, 6 degrees colder than the long-term July average of minus 0.1.",anecdote,1.3,CARDS
